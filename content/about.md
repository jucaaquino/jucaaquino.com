Juca Aquino is a Brazilian-Canadian artist currently 
studying at the University of Manitoba. Juca’s artistic 
practice is informed by Brazilian art and architecture 
like the Copacabana boardwalk, Ibirapuera Park and the 
skyscrapers on Paulista avenue. He first became 
interested in screenprinting when he saw Takashi 
Murakami’s maximalist murals at a retrospective in the 
Vancouver Art Gallery. Juca became fascinated with using 
code as a tool for creating visual art when he noticed 
that unintended results caused by bugs in the code are 
often more compelling than the intended results. Juca has 
done volunteering work for the Winnipeg Art Gallery, Plug 
In ICA and Art City.

Juca was born in São Paulo in 2004 and currently lives and works in Winnipeg, MB, Canada
