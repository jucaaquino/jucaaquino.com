![Juca Aquino Portrait](/portrait2.jpg)

Juca Aquino is a Brazilian-Canadian artist currently 
studying at the University of Manitoba. Juca’s artistic 
practice is informed by Brazilian art and architecture 
like the Copacabana boardwalk, Ibirapuera Park and the 
skyscrapers on Paulista avenue. He first became 
interested in screenprinting when he saw Takashi 
Murakami’s maximalist murals at a retrospective in the 
Vancouver Art Gallery. Juca became fascinated with using 
code as a tool for creating visual art when he noticed 
that unintended results caused by bugs in the code are 
often more compelling than the intended results. Juca has 
done volunteering work for the Winnipeg Art Gallery, Plug 
In ICA and Art City.

Juca was born in São Paulo in 2004 and currently lives and works in Winnipeg, MB, Canada.

<!--Imogene Strauss is a multidisciplinary creative director and designer. Born in
New York City, she lives and works in Los Angeles. Raised by artist parents and
constantly surrounded by inspiration, Imogene began working in the arts in her
early 20s managing Solange and Blood Orange and serving as a music
curator—notably of the legendary MoMA PS1 WarmUp series—alongside other
projects. Her work as a creative director evolved naturally out of the deep
artistic relationships she fostered with her management clients.
